# Fork of encoding/json

This is a fork of the `encoding/json` package that allows use of the `encoding/json/v2` package without requiring the `GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2` environment variable. The code is based on the Go 1.25.1 release.

This repository will be archived once the standard library is updated to allow use of the `encoding/json/v2` package without build constraints.

No changes will be made to the codebase except for updating it to the latest Go release.
